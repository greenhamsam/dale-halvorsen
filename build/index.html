          >“Dale Halvorsen is one of the finest plotters I know, and understands
          it all comes down to character. I’ve worked with him closely, as
          co-creator and co-writer on*Survivors’ Club*(currently in development
          with the CW) and our horror short, “This Book Will Find You”. He’s
          also he’s been an invaluable first reader and advisor throughout my
          novel-writing career, who has helped me navigate through many sticky
          entanglements and helped push the story harder and higher.”</i

          >“Dale is a brilliant storyteller with strong plot instincts. He’s
          helped me fix wonky television pitches and wrangled a particularly
          unruly novel plot into shape. When I feel like something’s not
          working, but I can’t put my finger on what it is, Dale is the person
          who can instantly identify what’s going wrong. He’s always the first
          person I go to when I need to talk through a story idea.”</i

      <p>
        This isn't a magic wand, I can't guarantee a specific outcome and I
        can't help you get your story published. What I offer is seasoned
        subjective advice and a nuanced understanding of plot and character and
        what makes a story work. The hard work of implementing the fixes is all
        on you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The costs above don’t include a second round of review once you have
        addressed my suggestions. If you’d like me to read your synopsis or
        manuscript again after you’ve fixed it, that would be treated as a new
        project.
